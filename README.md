# pg_ai

PostgreSQL extension with builtin RAG capabilities, enabling the interpretation and querying of data through both natural language and SQL functions.

## Overview

The pg_ai extension brings the power of AI and LLMs to SQL. pg_ai helps in:

(i) Facilitating natural language interaction with datasets:
Transforming query results from PostgreSQL tables into a vector store,
enabling interactions with the store through natural language.

(ii) Interpreting data stored in PostgreSQL tables using generative AI:
Leveraging LLMs' continual learning and evolving capabilities to gain fresh
insights into data, providing new interpretations over time and with each query
(Single Datum, Multiple Inferences SDMI),

## Build & Installation

```sh
cd pg_ai
make install
```
- pg_ai uses libcurl for communication with remote AI services, curl needs to be installed.
- needs [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension for vector operations.


## Getting Started (the pg_ai_* functions)

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_ai;
```

Choose the AI service 
```sql
SET pg_ai.service = 'OpenAI'(default)|'Gemini';
```

Set the API Key [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) or [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
```sql
SET pg_ai.api_key='qz********y';
```

#### Insights

Get the column data interpreted by LLM.
```sql
SELECT col1, col2, pg_ai_insight(col1) AS insight FROM my_table WHERE id > 5;
```

Aggregate version of the above function.
```sql
SELECT pg_ai_insight_agg(col1, 'Suggest a topic for these values') AS topic FROM my_table WHERE id > 5;
```

#### Vectors

Create vector store for a dataset.
```sql
 SELECT pg_ai_create_vector_store(store => 'movies_vec_store_90s',
                                  query => 'SELECT * FROM public.movies WHERE release_year > 1990',
                                  notes => 'movies released after 1990');
```

Query the vector store with a natural language prompt.
```sql
SELECT pg_ai_query_vector_store(store => 'movies_vec_store_90s',
                                prompt => 'movies on time travel',
                                count => 3);
```

```sql
SET pg_ai.similarity_algorithm='cosine'(default)|'euclidean'|'inner_product';
```

#### Moderations

Get the moderations for the column data.
```sql
SELECT col1, pg_ai_moderation(col1, NULL) FROM messages_table WHERE id=1;
```

Aggregate version of the above function.
```sql
SELECT pg_ai_moderation_agg(col1, NULL) FROM messages_table WHERE id<10;
```

## Notes

Models in use.

1. OpenAI - gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct
2. OpenAI - text-embedding-ada-002
3. OpenAI - text-moderation-stable
4. OpenAI - dall-e-3
5. Google AI- gemini-pro:generateContent

## TODO

* Develop parallelization framework for loading embedding vectors in the background.
* Improve curl read callbacks and add tokenization support to handle longer context data.
* Enable customization to utilize alternative local and remote LLMs.
* Separate storage layer to enable the creation and querying of remote vector stores,(object stores/dbs, file-based storage).
* Explore new vector index type (HNTW).
* Introduce the extension catalog.
